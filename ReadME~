Matt Yudysky Twitter App for Rue La La Internship

You need to edit the .py and add your own consumer and access informaion.
to run, just cd to the folder and type ./TwitterApp.py
The prompts provide all the necessary instructions for operation.

Note: I think that the api.GetUserTimeline command is broken. Regardless of
the User ID or Screen Name you provide it, it only retrieves the authorizer's
(my) timeline. This effects the Search From Person feature only.
